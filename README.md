# GreenWheel
GreenWheel is an application built to promote safer and more eco-friendly driving habits. It analyzes real driving behavior such as speed, acceleration, and braking to award eco-points for smooth, efficient driving while reducing points for aggressive or unsafe actions.

The system also incorporates real map data to determine the posted speed limit at the user’s current location. This allows GreenWheel to accurately detect speeding and give meaningful, real-world feedback about how responsibly the user is driving.

# Features
## Driving Data Analysis
* Tracks vehicle speed relative to actual posted speed limits  
* Evaluates acceleration and braking patterns to identify efficient or harsh driving  
* Generates a second-by-second breakdown of each drive  
* Calculates eco-points per trip, always rounding up and never allowing negative values  

## Progression System
* Keeps track of the user’s lifetime accumulated eco-points  
* Determines the user’s current level based on total points  
* Calculates how many points are required to reach the next level  
* Stores all drive, point, and level data in organized JSON files  

# Future Improvements
## Real-Time Monitoring
In future versions, GreenWheel is intended to evolve into a live-tracking system that can:
* Monitor driving behavior as it happens  
* Update eco-points in real time  
* Provide immediate feedback when the driver accelerates too hard or exceeds the speed limit  

## Leaderboard System
A competitive element is also planned, which would introduce:
* Global and local leaderboards  
* Weekly and monthly ranking resets  
* The ability to compare progress with friends, family, or other users  

## Rewards and Incentives
To make long-term use more engaging, future updates may include:
* Achievement badges for notable driving milestones  
* Unlockable perks or rewards tied to higher levels  
* Customizable profile elements for users who reach advanced tiers
